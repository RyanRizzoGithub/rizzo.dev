    <h1 style="font-size: 36px;">You can learn to love any genre of music [NEEDS EDIT]</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered why your favorite song affects you completely differently than it does someone else? Or why a particular genre moves you more deeply than others? Conversely, why might someone be obsessed with an artist you can't stand? We all know instinctively that music taste is subjective, but are we aware of what drives this bias?</p>
    <p>I propose that it can be broken down into three primary factors: exposure, authority, and identity. Furthermore, I suggest that increasing any one of these factors—individually or together—can enhance the enjoyment we get from listening to music, regardless of genre.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Exposure</h2>
    <p>It's no secret that music we've heard before has a more predictable effect on us than music that's unfamiliar. Try to recall a time you listened to a song for the first time, and compare it to how it makes you feel now. Did your opinion of it ever change? As an example, certain harmonies or rhythms in jazz often feel abrasive to a newcomer yet overtime beautiful to a more experienced listener. To a fresh ear, a colorful note might sound wrong, and a groove might feel sloppy rather than intentional. However a person with a lot of exposure may find this new and refreshing. Similarly, look at how cultural traditions shape expectations: Western music centers on the major scale, while Indian music often revolves around ragas. What we expect from music affects what we enjoy. But if we expand our expectations through exposure, we expand what we like to listen to.</p>
    <p>Exposure can be thought of as the collection of musical material a person has consumed. Someone with a lot of exposure typically has a broad and varied listening history, and can more easily identify genres, influences, and stylistic choices in a piece of music.</p>
    <p>Additionally, context plays a huge role in how we first hear a song, and how it gets stored in our memory. This might be its use in a movie, its presence in an online trend, or even an unrelated moment in life when it happened to play on the radio. These contexts shape the way we hear and feel the music.</p>
    <p>However, these contexts rarely reflect the artist's original intention. Because it is impossible to experience art without imposing our casting our own biases, our first impressions of music are always subjective. What does this mean? It means our opinions are mutable—we can change how we feel about a song if we allow ourselves to seek deeper understandings or perspectives regarding that piece of art. Doing so can alter the way the music sounds to us and the emotions it evokes, strengthening our connection to artists and expanding the range of music that resonates with us. In short: if our opinions are flexible, then so is our capacity to move from disliking to loving a song.</p>
    <p>Expanding our exposure is simple: listen to new types of music, spend time researching what makes them compelling, and give thoughtful attention to their creators. This kind of work expands not only our knowledge but also our capacity for enjoyment.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Authority</h2>
    <p>We often doubt our choices, especially with the vast number we are faced with these days. Because of this, it is common to look to and give faith to those who appear to have the skill and understanding that we wish to have ourselves.</p>
    <p>In a 2018 *Science Daily* report, the University of Connecticut found “that simply being told that a performer is a professional or a student changes the way the brain responds to music.” This demonstrates that our perception of quality is malleable—and that our enjoyment can be influenced not just by sound, but by our beliefs about the person producing it. If we are told that a piece is composed or performed by a master, we're more inclined to listen attentively, make sense of what might initially sound strange, and ultimately convince ourselves that we're hearing something valuable.</p>
    <p>This explains, in part, the power of music critics, playlists curated by tastemakers, and even the sway of peer recommendations. When someone we respect or admire introduces us to a song or artist and speaks highly of them, we're more inclined to listen with patience and curiosity. The music hasn't changed—only the context has.</p>
    <p>Authority can also emerge from analysis and understanding. When we learn *why* a certain musical technique works—such as how tension is created in atonal music, or how microtonal scales add expression in traditional Middle Eastern music—we gain access to a new layer of appreciation. Suddenly, what once seemed chaotic becomes intentional; what once sounded flat now feels rich and intricate. Our respect for the craft deepens, and so does our enjoyment.</p>
    <p>Put simply: when we learn to trust the authority of artists, scholars, or even our own analytical abilities, we open the door to loving music we once dismissed.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>Of all the forces shaping our taste, identity might be the most powerful—and the most invisible. What we listen to often says something about who we are, or at least who we *want* to be.</p>
    <p>Genres don't just describe musical styles; they often carry social, cultural, and political connotations. Punk represents rebellion. Country might evoke tradition. Jazz can symbolize sophistication, while electronic music might suggest futurism or underground cool. People use music as a tool of self-expression and tribal belonging. It forms part of how we build our personal and social identities.</p>
    <p>This can work both for and against us. On one hand, we gravitate toward music that reflects our values and aspirations. On the other, we may resist music that seems to belong to a culture or identity we don't associate with—or worse, that we actively reject. A metalhead might scoff at bubblegum pop not because of its sound, but because of what it represents. A classical purist might turn their nose up at trap music without ever engaging with its lyrical narratives or cultural roots.</p>
    <p>But what happens when we begin to blur those boundaries? If we start to see ourselves differently—or open ourselves up to other ways of being—we may find new genres opening up to us. This often happens during life transitions: moving to a new city, meeting new people, traveling, or undergoing personal growth. These shifts in identity allow us to soften the rigid walls we've built around what “our music” is.</p>
    <p>The exciting part is that identity is not fixed. As we evolve, our tastes can evolve too. By exploring music outside our usual genres, we are not betraying who we are—we are expanding who we are.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Loving music isn't just about the music itself—it's about *how* we engage with it. Through exposure, we train our ears and broaden our expectations. Through authority, we learn to trust artists, critics, or our own developing expertise. And through identity, we learn to connect with music not just as sound, but as a reflection of ourselves and the world we inhabit.</p>
    <p>Any genre—no matter how foreign, abrasive, or confusing it seems at first—can become meaningful, even beloved. All it takes is a willingness to listen with curiosity, openness, and patience. And in doing so, we don't just become better listeners; we become more empathetic, more connected, and more human.</p>
    <p>In the end, learning to love any genre of music isn't just about taste—it's about growth.</p>
